/**
 * The filesystem capability `env-cap/build` requires from its caller.
 *
 * `./build` is a **library surface**: it must not acquire filesystem access
 * implicitly (no `node:fs` import anywhere under `src/` outside `src/cli/`).
 * Every public options object in `build/index.ts` carries a required `fs`
 * field of this type, and the caller supplies a concrete adapter -- the
 * `env-cap` CLI builds one over `node:fs/promises` (`src/cli/filesystem.ts`);
 * a test builds either that same real adapter or an in-memory fake. See ADR
 * 0040.
 *
 * "Ambient-fs-free" means specifically: `./build` never reaches for
 * `node:fs` itself. It still performs real filesystem operations -- the
 * capability is always handed in.
 *
 * The shape is modeled on `node:fs/promises`'s own signatures so a thin
 * adapter is a drop-in value, but uses minimal structural types
 * ({@link BuildDirent}/{@link BuildStats}) rather than Node's `Dirent`/
 * `Stats` -- the capability boundary shouldn't leak Node's type surface just
 * because the concrete adapter happens to be Node-backed. Only the
 * operations `src/build/**` actually calls are here.
