 * already safe by construction -- it only ever walks *down* from `root` via
 * `readdir`, so a pattern can't make it read outside `root`. Output
 * locations have no such structural guarantee, since `path.resolve` happily
 * walks back out via `..` segments, so this is a plain lexical bounds-check
 * (not a symlink-aware `realpath` check -- these are *output* paths that
 * usually don't exist yet).
 *
 * Never throws itself -- returns a `CompatibilityIssue`-shaped finding on
 * escape so each generator function (`generateEnvManifest`, `generateDocumentation`,
 * `generateUsageReport`, `generateEnvArtifacts`) can wrap it in its own error type.
